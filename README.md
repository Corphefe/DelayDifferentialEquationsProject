# DelayDifferentialEquationsProject
This is my final project for a course in Non Linear Dynamics and Chaos where I looked into DDEs.

There is MatLAB code associated with this project. However, I uninstalled the 13GB MatLAB application from my poor old intel i5 device. The code is, however, still detailed in the appendix of my report.
